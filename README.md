### Motivation

I developed those tools around 2013 for reapairing iOS devices, and I needed a quick way to check if the screen was working correctly, but I didn't want to enter my AppleID on other people devices, so a WebApp was the way to go.

### iOS

It works quite well if you [Add to Home Screen](https://social2.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ios-mobile-app-home-screen.gif) so it can go full-screen.

### Stuck Pixels

On portable devices, specially on phones and tablets, you will need to disable the auto-lock or auto sleep, and leave it plugged in and let it run overnight.

You may change the brightness/backlight control to the minimum level to save energy, as it does not have any effect on the LCD itself.

### Desktop

Put your browser in full-screen to check the entire screen.
