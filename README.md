#### Motivation

I developed those tools around 2013 for reapairing iOS devices, and I needed a quick way to check if the screen was working correctly, but I didn't want to enter my AppleID on other people devices, so a WebApp was the way to go.

#### iOS

It works quite well if you [Add to Home Screen](https://social2.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ios-mobile-app-home-screen.gif) so it can go full-screen.

#### Stuck Pixels

Specially on mobile devices or portables, it is required to disable the auto-lock or auto sleep, in order to keep the pixels changing.

#### Desktop

If nescessary put your browser in full-screen.
